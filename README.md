Quest Interface
=============
This is a quest gui intergrated into the 'esc' menu in RPG Maker XP games. It provides basic funtionalities of showing quest description and tracking quest process. With its simple markup text implementation, it can serve as a diary book, a system manual or anything that needs to be presented in a text and image rich way.

The example also demostrate a way to implement a cross terrain transportation vehicle, which is often found in JRPGs such as Final Fantasy series. The tricky parts are switching terrain collision detection depending on player's vehicle type and memorizing vehicle location (so you don't lose your ship after a save and load!).
